                <li><b>1913</b> - born in Mondovi, French Algeria <small>(present-day Dréan, Algeria)</small></li>
                <li><b>1933</b> - Camus enrolled at the University of Algiers and completed his licence de philosophie (BA) in 1936; after presenting his thesis on <b>Plotinus</b>. Camus developed an interest in early Christian philosophers, but <b>Nietzsche</b> and <b>Arthur Schopenhauer</b> had paved the way towards pessimism and atheism. Camus also studied novelist-philosophers such as <b>Stendhal</b>, <b>Herman Melville</b>, <b>Fyodor Dostoyevsky</b>, and <b>Franz Kafka</b>.</li>
                <li><b>1935</b> - Camus joined the <b>French Communist Party</b> (PCF). He saw it as a way to "fight inequalities between Europeans and 'natives' in Algeria," even though he was not a Marxist. He explained: "We might see communism as a springboard and asceticism that prepares the ground for more spiritual activities." Camus left the PCF a year later.</li>
                <li><b>1936</b> - The independence-minded <b>Algerian Communist Party</b> (PCA) was founded, and Camus joined it after his mentor Grenier advised him to do so. Camus's main role within the PCA was to organise the <i>Théâtre du Travail</i> ("Workers' Theatre"). Camus was also close to the Parti du Peuple Algérien (<b>Algerian People's Party</b> (PPA)), which was a moderate anti-colonialist/nationalist party. As tensions in the interwar period escalated, the Stalinist PCA and PPA broke ties. Camus was expelled from the PCA for refusing to toe the party line. This series of events sharpened his belief in human dignity. Camus's mistrust of bureaucracies that aimed for efficiency instead of justice grew. He continued his involvement with theatre and renamed his group <i>Théâtre de l'Equipe</i> ("Theatre of the Team"). Some of his scripts were the basis for his later novels.</li>
                <li><b>1938</b> - Camus began working for the leftist newspaper <i>Alger républicain</i> (founded by Pascal Pia) as he had strong anti-fascist feelings, and the rise of fascist regimes in Europe was worrying him. By then, Camus had developed strong feelings against authoritative colonialism as he witnessed the harsh treatment of the Arabs and Berbers by French authorities.</li>
                <li><b>1940</b> - <i>Alger républicain</i> was banned and Camus flew to Paris to take a new job at <i>Paris-Soir</i> as editor-in-chief. In Paris, he almost completed his "first cycle" of works dealing with the absurd and the meaningless—the novel L'Étranger (<i>The Outsider</i> (UK), or <i>The Stranger</i> (US)), the philosophical essay <i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe (The Myth of Sisyphus)</i> and the play <i>Caligula</i>. Each cycle consisted of a novel, an essay and a theatrical play.</li>
                <li><b>Soon after</b> - Camus moved to Paris, the outbreak of World War II began to affect France. Camus volunteered to join the army but was not accepted because he had suffered from tuberculosis. As the Germans were marching towards Paris, Camus fled. He was laid off from <i>Paris-Soir</i> and ended up in Lyon, where he married pianist and mathematician <b>Francine Faure</b> on 3 December 1940.</li>
                <li><b>1940 - 1945</b>- Camus took an active role in the underground resistance movement against the Germans during the <b>French Occupation</b>. Upon his arrival in Paris, he started working as a journalist and editor of the banned newspaper <i>Combat</i>. He continued writing for the paper after the liberation of France. Camus used a pseudonym for his Combat articles and used false ID cards to avoid being captured. During that period he composed four <i>Lettres à un Ami Allemand</i> (<i>Letters to a German Friend</i>), explaining why resistance was necessary.</li>
                <li><b>1945-1951</b> - During this period he completed the second cycle of his work, with the essay <i>L'Homme révolté</i> (<i>The Rebel</i>). Camus attacked <b>totalitarian communism</b> while advocating <b>libertarian socialism</b> and <b>anarcho-syndicalism</b>. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France with his rejection of communism, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. His relations with the Marxist Left deteriorated further during the <b>Algerian War</b>.</li>
                <li><b>1944</b> - Camus founded the <i>Comité français pour la féderation européenne</i>—(CFFE (French Committee for the European Federation))-he was a strong supporter of European integration in various marginal organisations working towards that end.— Declaring that Europe "can only evolve along the path of economic progress, democracy, and peace if the nation states become a federation."</li>
                <li><b>1947–1948</b> - He founded the Groupes de liaison internationale (GLI) a trade union movement in the context of revolutionary syndicalism (<b>"syndicalisme révolutionnaire"</b>). His main aim was to express the positive side of surrealism and existentialism, rejecting the negativity and the nihilism of André Breton. Camus also raised his voice against the Soviet intervention in Hungary and the totalitarian tendencies of <b>Franco's</b> regime in Spain.</li> 
                <li><b>1957</b> - Camus received the news that he was to be awarded the <b>Nobel Prize in Literature</b>. At age 44, he was the second-youngest recipient of the prize, after <b>Rudyard Kipling</b>, who was 42. After this he began working on his autobiography <i>Le Premier Homme</i> (<i>The First Man</i>) in an attempt to examine "moral learning".</li>
                <li><b>1960</b> - Camus died on 4 January at the age of 46, in a car accident near Sens, in Le Grand Fossard in the small town of Villeblevin. There has been speculation that Camus was assassinated by the KGB because of his criticism of Soviet abuses. William Faulkner wrote his obituary, saying, <i>"When the door shut for him he had already written on this side of it that which every artist who also carries through life with him that one same foreknowledge and hatred of death, is hoping to do: I was here."</i></li>

            <h2>Suicide and The Absurdity of Life</h2>

            <p>Many existentialist writers have addressed the Absurd, each with their own interpretation of what it is and what makes it important. <b>Kierkegaard</b> explains that the absurdity of religious truths prevents us from reaching God rationally. <b>Sartre</b> recognizes the absurdity of individual experience. Camus's thoughts on the Absurd begins with his first cycle of books and the literary essay <i>The Myth of Sisyphus</i>, (<i>Le Mythe de Sisyphe</i>), his major work on the subject. In 1942 he published the story of a man living an absurd life in <i>L'Étranger</i>. He also wrote a play about the Roman emperor <b>Caligula</b>, pursuing an absurd logic, which was not performed until 1945. His early thoughts appeared in his first collection of essays, <i>L'Envers et l'endroit</i> (<i>Betwixt and Between</i>) in 1937. Absurd themes were expressed with more sophistication in his second collection of essays, <i>Noces</i> (<i>Nuptials</i>), in 1938 and <i>Betwixt and Between</i>. In these essays, Camus reflects on the experience of the Absurd. Aspects of the notion of the Absurd can be found in The Plague.</p>
            <p>Camus follows Sartre's definition of the Absurd: <i>"That which is meaningless. Thus man's existence is absurd because his contingency finds no external justification"</i>. The Absurd is created because man, who is placed in an unintelligent universe, realises that human values are not founded on a solid external component; or as Camus himself explains, the Absurd is the result of the <i>"confrontation between human need and the unreasonable silence of the world."</i> Even though absurdity is inescapable, Camus does not drift towards nihilism. But the realization of absurdity leads to the question: Why should someone continue to live? Suicide is an option that Camus firmly dismisses as the renunciation of human values and freedom. Rather, he proposes we accept that absurdity is a part of our lives and live with it.</p>
            <p>The turning point in Camus's attitude to the Absurd occurs in a collection of four letters to an anonymous German friend, written between July 1943 and July 1944. The first was published in the <i>Revue Libre</i> in 1943, the second in the <i>Cahiers de Libération</i> in 1944, and the third in the newspaper <i>Libertés</i>, in 1945. The four letters were published as <i>Lettres à un ami allemand</i> (<i>Letters to a German Friend</i>) in 1945, and were included in the collection Resistance, Rebellion, and Death.</p>
            <p>Camus regretted the continued reference to himself as a <i>"philosopher of the absurd"</i>. He showed less interest in the Absurd shortly after publishing Le Mythe de Sisyphe. To distinguish his ideas, scholars sometimes refer to the Paradox of the Absurd, when referring to <i>"Camus's Absurd"</i>.</p>
